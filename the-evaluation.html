            <h1 class="text">Artefact</h1>
            <h2 class="text">Time management</h2>
            <p class="text">One of the poorest things that I did in this CBA is time management: I only started
                constructing the machine the day before it was due. When I was first typing this, I had to hand in the
                project within 4 days.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was fortunate that my performance in this CBA was not heavily impacted by this, but my
                machine is definitely quite rudimentary compared to other projects I have seen: it doesn't even have an
                outer shell, and it had to be stuck onto the leg and shoe using blue-tac. It also led to some minor
                problems with the website that I would've been able to think of a solution to if I had managed my time
                better. For example, the header image for this page is blurry, and there are slight issues with some
                animations.
                <br>
                <br>
            <p class=text>I mean, this looks pretty rudimentary.</p>
            <br>

            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="text">Website</h1>
            <h2 class="text">Creativity and skills</h2>
            <p class="text">This website is definitely my proudest part of the project. I have spent hours, maybe even
                days learning, programming, and optimizing. I have learnt a lot throughout making the website, such as
                intermediate CSS and Javascript skills: there is a noticable difference between this website and the
                <a herf="https://852ethanyeung.github.io/coding-cba-2/" target="_blank" class="external-link">previous
                    one</a> I made for another computer project.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="text">Effects</h2>
            <p class="text">The two most noticable effects of the page are the hacker text effect in the home page and
                the border effect in the navigation menu. Not only did I learn to discover new techniques and ideas
                online, but I've also chosen to understand how the code work, and implement it in my website in a better
                and more advanced way, instead of just copying and pasting the code.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="text">Resources</h2>
            <p class="text">I've also learned to use resources online to my advantage. On my previous project, the
                only use of resources online was a tutorial on how to make a dropdown menu (which I copied and
                pasted into that website) and references to specific elements: I didn't really try to learn too much
                from the experience.
                <br><br>
                In this website however, I have been learning more and more web development skills throughout making
                the website. Even if I didn't get to use it here, I now have the knowledge of many more topics, such
                as asynchronous functions and APIs.
                <br><br>
                This scouring of resources have been key to making this website as it is. If you are wondering why I
                didn't include the pulsating circles of the navigation menu button in the "features" section of "the
                website", it is because I didn't create it myself. I discovered Javascript plugins, tools to make a
                programmers life easier, and I used my first ever plugin, which creates pulsating circles.
            </p>
            <div class="image-block image-right">
                <p class="text">
                    I also discovered other Javascript techniques and frameworks. Most notably, I discovered JQuery
                    early on into the project, and it was an absolute life-saver, providing me with a coding
                    experience that is much easier to organize, as well as many useful functions such as
                    $.getScript.
