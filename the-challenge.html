            <h1 class="text">Sight loss</h1>

            <p class="text">Sight loss is perhaps one of the most inconvenient disabilities. In a world where we are
                reliant on visual cues for many daily tasks, those who are visually impaired suffer the most. </p>
            </br>

            <p class="text">Navigation is one of the biggest challenges faced by visually impaired people, especially in
                unfamiliar spaces and buildings. There is currently a lack of adaptations for visually impaired people
                such as tactile paving, especially in indoor public spaces. </p>
            </br>

            <!-- href="" target="_blank" class="external-link"-->

            <p class="text">It is therefore no surprise that the visually impaired are much more susceptible to
                accidents and injuries than those who are not. 40% of visually impaired people state that they have
                collided with an aerial or suspended obstacle at least once every year, and a whopping 95% of them state
                that they have collided with an obstacle at least once <a
                    href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345500628_An_Artificial_Intelligence_Edge_Computing-Based_Assistive_System_for_Visually_Impaired_Pedestrian_Safety_at_Zebra_Crossings"
                    target="_blank" class="external-link">(Chang, Chen, Sie and Yang, 2021)</a>.</p>
            </br>

            <p class="text">There is also a social stigma associated with visual impairment. Small accidents such as
                stumbling upon a curb or knocking a glass of a table are often perceived by those without visual
                impairments as a lack of ability to perform basic tasks on the side of those with visual impairments,
                when in fact the truth is the world is simply too inaccessible <a
                    href="https://www.letsenvision.com/blog/challenges-blind-people-face-when-living-life"
                    target="_blank" class="external-link">(Envision, 2023)</a>. </p>
            </br>

            <p class="text">Visual impairments do not indicate how smart or happy a person is <a
                    href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment"
                    target="_blank" class="external-link">(WHO, 2022)</a>;
                however, it is shown that visually impaired people are often discouraged from going out to socialise and
                interact with other people <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0264619619833723"
                    target="_blank" class="external-link">(Jeamwatthanachai, Wald and Wills, 2019)</a>.</p>
            </br>

            <p class="text">We, people who do not suffer from visual impairments, built the world as it is today. It is
                our responsibility, as fellow humans, to help change it so it supports those who are visually impaired
                as well, so that they can both feel and be included in our society. One method of doing so is utilising
                technology.</p>
            </br>

            <p class="text">I may not be an engineer, but I hope I can offer parts of a solution in this CBA. Had this
                been suggested before, then let my project be another voice to encourage its development.</p>
