            <h1 class="text">Sight loss</h1>
            <p class="text">Sight loss is perhaps one of the most inconvenient disabilities. In a world where we are
                reliant on visual cues for many daily tasks, such as texting, working, or even just a walk in the
                streets, those who are visually impaired suffer the most. The lack of adaptations for these people also
                prove a problem: tools such as tactile paving are not yet widespread. It is therefore no surprise that
                the visually impaired are much more susceptible to accidents and injuries than those who are not. 40% of
                visually impaired people state that they have collided with an aerial or suspended obstacle at least
                once every year, and a whopping 95% of them state that they have collided with an obstacle at least once

            <p class="text">We, people who do not suffer from visual impairments, built the world as it is today. It is
                our responsibility, as fellow humans, to help change it so it supports those who are visually impaired
                as well. One method of doing so is utilising technology.</p>

            <p class="text">I may not be an engineer, but I hope I can offer parts of a solution in this CBA. Had this
                been suggested before, then let my project be another voice to encourage its development.</p>
